[Self-published in 2021](https://amzn.eu/d/9AooP0u), this is an italian novel that explore the tragedy of a young man. Below you'll find the back cover text, translated just for you.

*The anxiety of leaving controlled Fabio like a puppet, making him fidget with the hurry to move; it seemed as though he couldnâ€™t stay in Barcelona for even one more hour.*

*Deep in his mind lay a dangerous, ancient restlessness: once again, he found himself having to cowardly flee from the little he had built, driven by the need to start all over again.*

*Was it perhaps becoming a habit?*

*In other times, he would have psychoanalyzed himself, trying to extract the true reason for his constant desire to escape, but now that was no longer the case. He had to run, quickly thinking and acting. A fear fueled his madness: if he stopped to reflect, he would surely understand something terrible.*



Who knows, maybe one day I'll work on a full English translation?
