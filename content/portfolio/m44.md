service: Full Product Managing
client: Private Company
shortDescription: Architecture, development and deployment of a full-stack web app to be integrated into a pipeline of chained software to manage the full engineering of one of the client's products.
challenge: The client was building a complex chain of tools to automate the complete engineering workflow for one of their core products, from initial design to ordering materials. Each tool needed to integrate smoothly into the existing chain, with no room for delays or bottlenecks. I was brought in to design, develop, and deploy a full-stack web app as part of this pipeline—a critical component that had to meet strict requirements for performance, compatibility, and scalability.
solution: I developed the tool with a Java Spring Boot backend to handle the processing logic and API, connected to an SQL database for robust data storage and retrieval. The frontend was built in Angular, offering a responsive and user-friendly interface that fit seamlessly into the client’s pipeline. After development, I deployed the entire stack on a Linux server, ensuring stable performance and easy maintenance. This setup allowed the tool to integrate smoothly with the other components in the chain, meeting all requirements for speed, compatibility, and scalability.

The client was in the middle of building a chain of tools to automate everything for one of their core products—from design to ordering materials. This was a pretty complex setup, and every tool in the chain had to work together smoothly. They brought me in to develop a full-stack web app that would fit seamlessly into this pipeline, with no room for any glitches or lag that might slow down the whole process.

For the backend, I went with Java Spring Boot to handle all the processing and API calls, paired with an SQL database to manage the data storage. The frontend was done in Angular, which gave it a clean, responsive interface that the team could easily work with. Once everything was ready, I deployed it on a Linux server, which meant stable performance and straightforward maintenance down the line.

The end result was a robust, integrated tool that clicked right into place within the client’s existing setup. It met all the demands for speed, compatibility, and scalability, letting the client move faster through their engineering process without any of the usual bottlenecks. All in all, it was a smooth fit that kept their workflow moving like clockwork.
