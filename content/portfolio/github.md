Personal Projects, for fun and learning purpose, can be found on [my GitHub](https://github.com/gesucca-official).

There you'll find a collection of my personal favourites, showcasing my skills in software development and more. I enjoy building full-stack applications, exploring new technologies, and tackling challenges through code.

Each project reflects my commitment to clean, efficient, and maintainable code. Feel free to explore my repositories, contribute to the discussions, or reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas.
