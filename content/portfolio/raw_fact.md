service: Architecture and Development
client: Private Company
shortDescription: Architecture and development of a customization for a widely-used CAD and modeling software, enabling users to automatically design and draw raw materials for components over their machined 2D schemes. 
challenge: The client required a solution to drastically reduce the time spent manually designing raw materials for a specific set of components and to streamline their import into PLM software.
solution: I developed software that identifies lines and splines of the target machined component in the 2D study drawing, allowing users to review proposed parameters, overlay the raw material on the model, and handle the import process.

The client’s workflow for designing raw materials and getting them into their PLM system was eating up way too much time. Every component required manual work just to prepare and import, so they wanted a way to speed up the process and get their engineers out of repetitive tasks.

I built a tool that automatically picks out lines and splines in 2D study drawings of each machined component. Engineers can check and adjust parameters easily, then overlay the raw material on the model to make sure everything’s in place before importing. Once it’s good to go, the tool handles the PLM import in one go.

Now, instead of burning hours on the basics, the team can knock out raw material designs and imports fast, with fewer errors. They’re free to spend time on the stuff that actually matters, and the workflow is a lot smoother.

This project opened the way to a [much more ambitious one](../mmop).
