  ## About me

  Born in Florence back in '92. Outstanding software engineer and fearless musician, greedy reader and generous writer. 
  
  I despise hard work and stupidity in general, and I fully embrace pragmatism.

  ### I solve problems you don't know you have --- in a way you don't understand

  Yeah, that quote is not the freshest in town. 
  Anyway, as a reasonably gifted man, blessed --- or cursed? --- with many talents, I always felt obligated to make full use of them all.
