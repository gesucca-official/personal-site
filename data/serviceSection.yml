    ## Expressing my creativity

    Music has always been a core part of my life, but maybe not in the way you'd expect. 
  
    As a solo artist under the pseudonym *gesucca*, my love for shiny, colorful, and bleepy-bloopy sounds has inspired me to create numerous releases across a wide range of genres.
  
    Below, you’ll find a summary of my work --— everything, of course, is available on all major streaming platforms.
